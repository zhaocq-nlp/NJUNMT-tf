beijing attacked by another serious sandstorm
agence france presse , beijing -- according to chinese state media , beijing had another serious sandstorm yesterday .
despite costly environmental efforts to halt the advance of the desert to beijing , sandstorms continue their frequent annual assault on the capital city . sandstorms look like to remain a serious challenge to beijing , which is going to host the 2008 olympics .
according to china meteorological administration 's forecasts , the year 's first sandstorm struck beijing last friday with further windy cold fronts from the mongolian steppe expected to shroud beijing in a yellow , dusty haze .
" i cannot say sandstorms will not occur in 2008 , " yang weixi ( transliteration ) , chief engineer of the desertification control center of china 's ministry of forestry told the beijing weekend publication .
" what we can do is to manage the man-made factors which cause sandstorms and the expansion of desertification , " he said .
however , conditions beyond human control , like wind , drought and huge existing deserts , would make it impossible to get rid of the storms in a short time frame , yang said .
the chinese government has committed to spend renminbi 56.8 billion ( about singapore dollars 12.376 billion ) to curb desertification and lessen sandstorms between 2002 and 2008 .
beijing alone will spend approximately renminbi 1 billion ( about singapore dollars 220 million ) this year .
" the increase in funding will greatly improve the situation , but ... it may take decades to see a gradual improvement , " an expert of the china forestry research institute said .
chinese environmentalists raised alarm bells after a survey earlier this year , which found almost a third of the country 's land mass is now desert largely due to human economic activity , such as livestock overgrazing .
in the first six months of 2001 , beijing was hit by 18 sandstorms originating from inner mongolia , where 60 percent of the land is desert , the survey said .
national people 's congress lawmakers from shanghai , beijing and inner mongolia , who met in beijing this month , have urged the government to set up a " green wall " of trees to block the dust storms .
the vice president of the geographical society of china , xu shiyuan , warned that if the government failed to take action , sandstorms could blow as far as shanghai , the shanghai star newspaper said .
forged diplomas are flooding china ; some cadres on the job are also holding forged diploma
comprehensive report , hong kong -- false diplomas are flooding mainland china . guangdong college graduate career center has completed the verification of academic certificates held by fifteen government officials submitted to the center by a city in chao-shan regions . seven of them can be confirmed to be a forgery simply through visual examination .
according to reports in hong kong newspapers , the center commenced verification services since may this year . it has so far examined more than 3,500 certificates and more than 800 certificates are found to be forgeries of one kind or the other . that is a forging rate of 23 % .
according to the reports , most of the forged certificates relate to adult education and self-study examination certificates . approximately two-third are forged in the street and the other one-third are forged by formal educational institutions .
at the time the center was first established , many institutions are in the process of reform . hence , units of organizations or enterprises have submitted the bulk of the certificates for verification . in many cases , the owners of the forged certificates are actually cadres currently on the job , the officer-in-charge of the center said .
at present , guangdong college graduate career center is the only institution authorized by the related department of china 's ministry of education to provide higher education qualification verification services in china
in one occasion , to facilitate decision on selecting officer , a municipal level state-owned bank has sent in 36 diplomas of middle-level officers and some key cadres for verification . the result is that only 6 diplomas are genuine , the officer-in-charge said .
it is understood that many private enterprises have also employed the verification services and their main interests are diplomas of job applicants and newly recruited university students .
the verification department has also found many forged university credentials
last year , a large enterprise has recruited a large batch of university students for its branch office in zhu jiang delta area .
the boss has sent in the credentials of more than 30 employees for verification and it was found that ten of them were forgeries .
in recent years , many educational institutions from rest of china have established a branch office in guangdong . these institutions have no rights to confer educational qualification . however , these institutions frequently play tricks to attract more students and claim that they can confer certificates recognized by the state . when students graduate , these institutions have to make a batch of forged certificates for the students .

new yorker magazine : iraqi intelligence has been in close touch with al-qaida group for years
comprehensive report , washington -- the latest issue of new yorker magazine suggests that iraqi intelligence has been in close touch with top officials in al-qaida group for years . the al-qaida group is believed to have masterminded the 911 incident .
it is believed that the two organizations jointly run a terrorist group that operates in the kurdish area of northern iraq .
u.s. central intelligence agency has expressed doubts on the proposition that iraqi president saddam hussein has maintained links with al-qaida .
a " hawkish " faction within the bush administration that favors military action against iraq has scoured the world for such saddam-al-qaida connections .
yesterday some people in this camp hailed the " new yorker " article as significant new evidence supporting their viewpoint .
the article said there is a muslim guerrilla group in the kurdish zone of iraq called ansar al-islam , which is made up of iraqi kurds and arabs trained in bin laden 's camps .
the article 's author , jeffrey goldberg , wrote that he interviewed several operatives of the group who had been captured by the " patriotic union of kurdistan " ( puk ) , a pro-american kurdish group . the captives said that saddam hussein and al-qaida are running ansar . a number of al-qaida fighters fleeing afghanistan have already escaped to iraqi kurdish territory controlled by ansar .
these captives also said that iraq hosted a top egyptian leader of al-qaida in baghdad in 1992
u.s. officials warned that the puk has an interest in making this case because it could help justify an american incursion to topple saddam .

in england , soaring levels of street-crime : more officers on the beat
associated press , london -- the british government steps up the efforts to fight soaring levels of street-crime and intends to deploy more policemen to patrol the streets .
home secretary david blunkett said it is important to have more patrol officers if the government is to control the soaring levels of robbery and violence on the streets .

according to the british government , the massive increase in robbery is mainly due to soaring mobile phone snatchings . about 700,000 mobile phones were snatched last year .
this is the first time that british police will target street rogues and street robbery . in the past , actions are usually directed at illegal possession of firearms and drug trafficking on the streets .
the new program will first be carried out in 10 areas , which suffer most from soaring street-crimes .

singapore airlines ' crash in taiwan : aviation safety council has delayed its report ; prosecutor 's office is asking why
taipei news -- the singapore airlines crash had happened for more than one and half years . however , taiwan 's aviation safety council ( sac ) has delayed the release of its final report several times , which has effectively made the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor 's office to a standstill . the prosecutor 's office is challenging the rationale and sac has now undertaken to release a report before end of april .
on october 31 , 2000 at 11 : 18 pm , singapore airlines ' sq-006 attempted to take off from chiang kai shek international airport for los angeles . in the course of the take off , the plane entered 05 - right runway . the plane then hit two dredgers that were on the runway . the impact caused an explosion and the death of 83 passengers . more than 100 passengers were injured in the accident .
" china times " reported yesterday : the taoyuan prosecutor 's office has been investigating for possible criminal liabilities in parallel to a probe into the cause of the crash by sac . unfortunately , the two have several disputes over investigation rights .
from the date of the crash till now , taoyuan district court chief prosecutor wang teng-sheng in charge of the case was promoted chief prosecutor for taichung . chen sou-huang filled his position . the case was then taken over by prosecutor huang mo-hsin but he was also transferred to taipei later . the case is currently the responsibility of chiang yuan-chen .
sac originally says that they can complete the investigation by the end of last year . sac subsequently delayed the report to end of january . by january , sac changed the report date to end of february and there is no further news since then . after pressed by the prosecutor 's office , sac has now undertaken to delver a report by the end of april .
the destination of sq-006 was los angeles and some passengers are americans . hence , some family members of passengers who died in the crash have already commenced legal actions in u.s. courts for damages against singapore airlines and also in some cases , against taiwan 's civil aeronautics administration .
the claims by family members are equivalent to an accusation of negligence on the part of taiwan 's civil aeronautics administration . hence , the conclusion of the investigation by taoyuan prosecutor 's office becomes important .

large enough to flatten an average city , asteroid brushed past the earth at close shave
associated press , melbourne and florida -- an asteroid , large enough to flatten an average city , brushed past the earth within a short range of 463,000 kilometers , but was not discovered in time . it was four days after the close shave could astronomers tell about it .
this asteroid , about 50 meters in diameter , was flying from the direction of the sun , thus astronomers could hardly detect it .
the asteroid brushed past the earth on march 8 , but was not detected until march 12 when the asteroid was gone .
williams of the international astronomical union 's minor planet center in cambridge , massachusetts , has helped in determining the astronomical position of this asteroid .
from the astronomical point of view , this asteroid was very close to the earth because the moon is only 402,000 kilometers away from the earth .
williams on wednesday spoke to ' florida today ' , " the key is to detect asteroids before they are flying from the direction of the sun . "
thus , astronomers can determine an asteroid 's orbit sooner , predicting whether it will hit the earth or not .
when an asteroid of similar size hit the earth in 1908 , it blasted out a crater of 32 kilometers wide in the forest of siberia .

he was on tuesday night shot to death by two motorcyclists outside his home in the northern city of bologna right after he biked home . the news shocked the italian political circles .
biagi had helped in drafting a labor reform proposal that provoked strong protests from labor unions and the leftists .
they thought that the proposal would make it easier for employers to layoff workers .
a witness said that biagi was lying in a pool of blood , with his briefcase on the side .
red brigades ' five-star symbol has been engraved on the door of biagi 's home . however , it is not known at this moment when that was done .
formed in 1973 , red brigades were suspected of carrying out a series of bombings and assassinations in the 70s and 80s , including the kidnapping and killing of former prime minister aldo moro in 1978 .

in the past 2 years , a number of american citizens and residents have been charged with violating the chinese national security laws , and fang fuming being one of them .
fang fuming 's detention has once caused tensions to sino-us relations .
the us government has repeatedly protested to china over her way of handling the fang fuming case . authorities have detained fang for months without putting him to trial , which is a violation of international standards .
fang fuming 's family said that he has been treated badly .
his wife and two children are us citizens .
