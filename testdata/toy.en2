hundreds of thousands of soldiers from us and rok launch large-scale exercise
( afp report from seoul ) - hundreds of thousands of soldiers from us and the republic of korea will be launching the largest-ever military exercise on thursday to simulate conflict with dpr korea , who has denounced it as provocative .
us army officials said before the week-long military exercise that this exercise was purely defensive , but it happens after seoul warned of the danger of ignoring the dprk issue .
this is the largest military exercise since the 1950 - 53 korean war . since no formal treaty was concluded to end the conflict on the korean peninsula , it has become the world 's last frontier of cold war , putting up to 2 million troops in a state of confrontation .
the joint us-rok combined forces command ( cfc ) based in seoul said the exercise from march 21 to 27 is the first time to combine two different joint exercises to see its effect .
it means involvement of hundreds of thousands of soldiers , but the military has not disclosed any details .
a spokesman for cfc said almost all us and rok military units based in the korean peninsula are deployed in addition to the incoming us troops .
some 37,000 us soldiers are stationed in rok permanently to prevent the 1.1 million dprk troops from launching any attacks .
rok has an army of 650,000 .
the cfc named this exercise rs01 / fe02 , which is a combination of computerized military exercise and the annual exercise , " little eagle " .
in the past few years , 500,000 rok soldiers and 30,000 american soldiers ( including 20,000 incoming american soldiers ) were deployed in the rs01 exercise .
dprk accused us of intending to wage a war by holding the joint exercise .

it was revealed that the dongcheng district and the liangmahe area of chaoyang district of beijing are inhabited by about 10,000 koreans , most of whom are ethnic koreans from northeast china and some from dprk and rok , who mainly operate korean-style restaurants and bars . as koreans , they live in peace together regardless of where they come from .
there were not many korean nationals in beijing before and few were involved in criminal cases like people from xinjiang and henan , making them the less conspicuous target of surveillance of the authorities .
reports said the ministry of public security " invited " the german doctor who assisted the 25 koreans to the public security agencies to " have a talk " after the march 14 incident and sent him to the airport shortly afterwards and demanded him to leave china immediately .
the public security and the state security agencies began internal review afterwards .
the review was centered around two aspects : the guarding of the embassy quarters and administration of ethnic koreans in beijing .
the authorities also requested related agencies in areas like jilin to take effective measures to keep koreans illegally entering chinese territory from going to beijing .

asteroid capable of ruining a mid-sized city passed by earth
( ap report from melbourne , florida ) - an asteroid big enough to ruin a mid-sized city passed by in a close range of 463,000 kilometres off earth without being noticed in advance . astronomers learned of the event four days later .
the asteroid , about 50 metres in diameter , came in the direction of sun , which made it hard for astronomers to discover .
the asteroid passed by the earth on march 8 , but was discovered on march 12 when it was gone .
williams from the international association of astronomy based in cambridge of massachusetts helped position the asteroid .
the asteroid was very close to the earth in astronomic terms , because the moon is 402,000 kilometres off earth .
williams told the florida-based newspaper , today , on wednesday , " the key is that the asteroid should have been discovered before it started off in the direction of sun .
only that would make the astronomers ascertain the asteroid 's orbit as early as possible and forecast whether it will hit earth .
in 1908 , an asteroid of the similar size hit the earth , leaving a pit 32 kilometres wide in siberia 's forests .
minister of internal affairs confirms the senior adviser to the italian government shot dead by red brigade
( afp report from rome ) - scajola , italian minister of internal affairs confirmed the day before yesterday that biagi , a senior advisor to the italian government was shot dead by a branch of italy 's left-wing guerrilla red brigade .
scajola said the two men who killed biagi even used the same pistol as used in a similar political assassination three years ago .
in a related development , italian prime minister berlusconi has voluntarily invited the trade union leaders back to the negotiation table to discuss the employment reform scheme he proposed .
the 52 - year-old advisor to the labour ministry biagi is also an economist and a law professor .
he was shot dead by assassins riding a motor bike when he was riding a bicycle back to his home tuesday night in the northern city of bologana in italy , which shocked italy 's political community .
biagi once helped drafting an employment reform scheme that was been strongly opposed by the trade unions and the left-wing .
they thought the scheme would make it easier for employers to fire workers .
witnesses said biagi was lying in blood with his file case on his side
the door of biagi 's house was found to have been inscribed with a star symbolizing the red brigade , but it is not known when the inscription was made .
the red brigade was founded in 1973 and has been involved in many bombings and assassinations in italy in the 1970s and 80s , including the kidnapping and killing of former prime minister moro in 1978 .

( ap report from beijing ) - the no . 1 intermediate people 's court of beijing yesterday sentenced chinese american engineer fang fuming 5 years in jail on charges of illegal procurement of the state secrets and bribing on behalf of a company .
this case has drawn protest from the us .
a spokesman for the us embassy to china said fang fuming will be expelled after he finishes serving his sentence .
the term of imprisonment will be adjusted to the time he has served in jail .
the us embassy sent a diplomat to observe the court hearing .
the lawyer representing fang fuming said his client has been jailed for two years , but china has denied the said period of jail .
xihua news agency has confirmed the relevant judgement .
it said fang fuming acquired 35 documents containing state secrets from 1995 to 1999 and bribed chinese civil servants with us $ 245,000 ( approximate 450,000 singapore dollars ) to help foreign investors bid for china 's electricity projects .
fang fuming is a consultant on electricity projects for a foreign company in china and other asian areas .
fang fuming 's lawyer kohn said that fang fuming denied bribery and said he was a victim of corrupted chinese officials in the electricity administration .
fang fuming was an official in china 's electricity administration and became a us citizen in 1994 .
a handful of us citizens and residents have been accused of violating china 's state security law in the past two years and fang is one of them .
fang fuming 's detention caused the tension of the sino-american relations for a while
the us government has repeatedly protested against china 's approach in handling fang fuming 's case , accusing chinese authorities of violating international principles by detaining fang fuming for months without holding a hearing .
fang fuming 's family said he was badly treated .

china cancels naval fleet visit to us and refuses to confirm hu jingtao 's scheduled visit
( summary of reports from beijing ) - the warming relations between us and china brought about by us president bush 's visit to china has turned cold rapidly as china confirmed yesterday to have cancelled its naval fleet 's visit to the us ports this year , and refused to confirm whether vice-president hu jingtao will visit the us as scheduled .
foreign ministry spokeswoman zhang qiyue said when answering questions at the regular press conference , " as far as i know , china 's naval fleet is being prepared for a planned visit , which does not include us ports . "
when asked twice by a journalist whether hu jingtao 's visit to the us has been affected and when requested to clarify whether the earlier reply could be understood as that hu jingtao 's visit to the us in april will go on as scheduled , zhang made no comments or confirmation .

"
in another development , in washington on wednesday the us paid no attention to china 's warning that " cold wind " is blowing on sino-us relations and insisted that it is not improper to permit taiwan 's defence minister to attend the " us-taiwan defence summit " held in florida .
beijing has repeatedly hit out at the us issuing visa to taiwanese defence minister tang yiau-ming earlier this month to attend the meeting hosted by the us arms dealers .
tang yiau-ming also met with two senior officials of the us government at that time .
richard boucher , spokesman for the us state department was questioned by journalists at the regular press conference on china 's protest of the issue , but he apparently tried to avoid squabble with china .
he said , " our stance is known to everyone after the meeting . "
" if you would ask me about the issue everyday , i would like to explain it everyday . if china would ask about the issue everyday , we would explain it everyday . "
he said , " our stance has not changed . these are normal contacts between us and the taiwanese and we will continue to do so . "
zhang qiyue yesterday also confirmed the russian press reports that chinese president jiang zemin had a phone call with russian president putin at the request of the latter , and the two sides exchanged views on cooperation between china and russia based on mutual benefit . "
both sides believed that the cooperation between china and russia on mutual benefit is in the interest of both the countries and their people .
